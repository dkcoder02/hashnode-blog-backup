# Overview:

* **Key Concepts**
    
* Learn about token based Authentication.
    
* Difference Between Access Token and Refresh Token.
    
* Why to use Refresh Token ?
    

# Access Token:

Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API

---

# Refresh Token:

A refresh token is a special key that enables a client for an API or service to retrieve new access tokens without requiring the user to perform a complete login. In other words, an application can exchange a valid refresh token for a new access token. In addition to the new access token, the service may return a new refresh token too

---

# Why to use Refresh Token :

Refresh tokens are commonly used in authentication systems, particularly in scenarios involving long-lived access to resources or services. They are employed to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials, enhancing security and user experience.

***Here is an example scenario to illustrate the usage of a refresh token:***

Let say you have a mobile application that accesses a userâ€™s data from a server. When the user logs in for the first time, they provide their username and password. The server validates these credentials and, if they're correct, issues two tokens: an access token and a refresh token.

* ***Access Token*** : This token has a shorter lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes) and is used by the application to access the user's data from the server. It expires relatively quickly for security reasons.
    
* ***Refresh Token*** :This token has a longer lifespan (e.g., several days or weeks) compared to the access token. It is used exclusively to obtain a new access token once the old one expires.
    

Now, as the application uses the access token to make requests to the server, after 15 minutes, the access token expires. At this point, instead of asking the user to log in again, the application uses the refresh token to request a new access token from the server.

***Example of how this works:***

1. User logs in and gets an access token and a refresh token.
    
2. The access token is used to access the user's data on the server.
    
3. After 15 minutes, the access token expires.
    
4. The application sends the refresh token to the server.
    
5. The server validates the refresh token. If valid, it issues a new access token to the application.
    
6. The application continues to access the user's data using the new access token.

## **Conclusion**

the strategic use of access and refresh tokens ensures robust security while maintaining a seamless user experience, balancing the need for protection with convenience.
